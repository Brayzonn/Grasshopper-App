#Grasshopper Learning App Clone using HTML, CSS and JS.

Recreated a one page learning app. Implemented FlexBox, Array methods, DOM manipulation using JS, ES6 feautures, media queries, element positioning and CSS/JS animations. 
This is my first project, and I'm very much open to ideas, mentorship and suggestions.
Looking forward to learning and building more projects.
