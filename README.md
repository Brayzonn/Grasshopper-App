#Grasshopper Learning App Clone using HTML, CSS and JS.

Recreated a one page learning app. Implemented FlexBox, Array methods, DOM manipulation using Js, ES6 feautures and CSS/JS animations. 
This is my first project, and I'm very much open to ideas, mentorship and suggestions.
Here is the link to the Frontend Practice Grasshopper project for those interested  ==> https://grasshopper.app/
